\title{Class "MultipleChoiceTable"}
\description{
Class \code{MultipleChoiceTable} is responsible for creating assessment tasks
according to the QTI 2.1 standard with a table of answer options, where many
correct answers in each row and column are possible.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{identifier}}{A character representing the unique identifier of the
assessment task. By default, it is generated as 'id_task_dddd', where dddd
represents random digits.}

\item{\code{title}}{A character representing the title of the XML file associated
with the task. By default, it takes the value of the identifier.}

\item{\code{content}}{A list of character content to form the text of the question,
which can include HTML tags. For tasks of the \link{Entry} type, it must also
contain at least one instance of Gap objects, such as \linkS4class{TextGap},
\link{NumericGap}, or \link{InlineChoice}.}

\item{\code{prompt}}{An optional character representing a simple question text,
consisting of one paragraph. This can supplement or replace content in the
task. Default is "".}

\item{\code{points}}{A numeric value, optional, representing the number of points for
the entire task. Default is 1, but pay attention:
\itemize{
\item For tasks of the \link{Entry} type, it is
calculated as the sum of the gap points by default.
\item For tasks of the \link{MatchTable} type, it can also be calculated as the sum
of points for individual answers, when provided.
\item For tasks of the \link{MultipleChoice} type, points is numeric vector and
required. Each number in this vector determines the number of points that
will be awarded to a candidate if they select the corresponding answer. The
order of the scores must match the order of the \code{choices}. It is possible
to assign negative values to incorrect answers. All answers with a
positive score are considered correct.
}}

\item{\code{feedback}}{A list containing feedback messages for candidates. Each
element of the list should be an instance of either \link{ModalFeedback},
\link{CorrectFeedback}, or \link{WrongFeedback} class.}

\item{\code{calculator}}{A character, optional, determining whether to show a
calculator to the candidate. Possible values:
\itemize{
\item "simple-calculator"
\item "scientific-calculator"
}}

\item{\code{files}}{A character vector, optional, containing paths to files that will
be accessible to the candidate during the test/exam.}

\item{\code{metadata}}{An object of class \link{QtiMetadata} that holds metadata information
about the task.}

\item{\code{rows}}{A character vector specifying answer options as row names in the
table or the first elements in couples in \link{DirectedPair}.}

\item{\code{rows_identifiers}}{A character vector, optional, specifying identifiers
for answer options defined in rows of the table or identifiers of the first
elements in couples in \link{DirectedPair}.}

\item{\code{cols}}{A character vector specifying answer options as column headers in
the table or the second elements in couples in \link{DirectedPair}.}

\item{\code{cols_identifiers}}{A character vector, optional, specifying identifiers
for answer options defined in columns of the table or identifiers of the
second elements in couples in \link{DirectedPair}.}

\item{\code{answers_identifiers}}{A character vector specifying couples of
identifiers that combine the correct answers.}

\item{\code{answers_scores}}{A numeric vector, optional, where each number determines
the number of points awarded to a candidate if they select the
corresponding answer. If not assigned, the individual values for correct
answers are calculated from the task points and the number of correct
options.}

\item{\code{shuffle}}{A boolean value, optional, determining whether to randomize the
order in which the choices are initially presented to the candidate.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{\code{shuffle_rows}}{A boolean value, optional, determining whether to
randomize the order of the choices only in rows. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{\code{shuffle_cols}}{A boolean value, optional, determining whether to
randomize the order of the choices only in columns. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{\code{mapping}}{Do not use directly; values are initialized automatically.
This slot contains a named numeric vector of points, where names correspond
to all possible combinations of row and column identifiers.}
