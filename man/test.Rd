\arguments{
\item{content}{A list containing \link{AssessmentSection} objects.}

\item{identifier}{A character value indicating the identifier of the test
file. Default is 'test_identifier'.}

\item{title}{A character value, optional, representing the file title.
Default is 'Test Title'.}

\item{time_limit}{An integer value, optional, controlling the time given to a
candidate for the test in minutes. Default is 90 minutes.}

\item{max_attempts}{An integer value, optional, indicating the maximum number
of attempts allowed for the candidate. Default is 1.}

\item{academic_grading}{A named numeric vector that defines the grade table shown to the candidate as feedback at the end of the test. The default is the German grading system:
gt <- c("1.0" = 0.95, "1.3" = 0.9, "1.7" = 0.85, "2.0" = 0.8, "2.3" = 0.75, "2.7" = 0.7, "3.0" = 0.65, "3.3" = 0.6, "3.7" = 0.55, "4.0" = 0.5, "5.0" = 0)
Each grade corresponds to a minimum percentage score required to achieve it.
To hide the grading table at the end of the test, set this parameter to NA_real_.}

\item{grade_label}{A character value, optional; a short message that shows
with a grade in the final feedback; for multilingual use, it can be a named
vector with two-letter ISO language codes as names (e.g., c(en="Grade",
de="Note")); during test creation, it takes the value for the language of
the operating system; c(en="Grade", de="Note")is default.}

\item{table_label}{A character value, optional; a concise message to display
as the column title of the grading table in the final feedback; for
multilingual use, it can be a named vector with two-letter ISO language
codes as names (e.g., c(en="Grade", de="Note")); during test creation, it
takes the value for the language of the operating system; c(en="Grade",
de="Note")is default.}

\item{navigation_mode}{A character value, optional, determining the general
paths that the candidate may have during the exam. Two mode options are
possible:
- 'linear': Candidate is not allowed to return to previous questions.
- 'nonlinear': Candidate is free to navigate; used by default.}

\item{submission_mode}{A character value, optional, determining when the
candidate's responses are submitted for response processing. One of two
mode options is possible:
- 'individual': Submit candidates' responses on an item-by-item basis; used by default.
- 'simultaneous': Candidates' responses are submitted all together by the end of the test.}

\item{allow_comment}{A boolean, optional, enabling the candidate to leave
comments in each question. Default is \code{TRUE.}}

\item{rebuild_variables}{A boolean, optional, enabling the recalculation of
variables and reshuffling the order of choices for each item-attempt.
Default is \code{TRUE.}}

\item{contributor}{A list of objects \link{QtiContributor}-type that holds
metadata information about the authors.}

\item{description}{A character string providing a textual description of the
content of this learning object.}

\item{rights}{A character string describing the intellectual property rights
and conditions of use for this learning object. By default it takes value
from environment variable 'RQTI_RIGHTS'.}

\item{version}{A character string representing the edition/version of this
learning object.}
