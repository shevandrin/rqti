\description{

}
\section{Authentication}{
 To use OPAL API, you need to provide your OPAL-
username and password. This function will look for api_user and
api_password environment variables. To set a global environment variables,
you need to use the following commands:
\code{Sys.setenv(api_user ='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')}
\code{Sys.setenv(api_password =  'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')}
Another way to assign environment variables in case of regular using is to
create a file named .env in the root directory of your project. The .env
file should contain the environment variables you want to set in the
following format:
\code{api_user=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx}
\code{api_password=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx}
}
