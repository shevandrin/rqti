\item{\code{identifier}}{A character representing the unique identifier of the
assessment test. By default, it is generated as 'id_test_dddd', where dddd
represents random digits.}

\item{\code{title}}{A character representing the title of the test. By default, it

\item "nonlinear" - candidate is free to navigate. This is used by default.
}}

\item{\code{submission_mode}}{A character value, optional, determining when the
candidate's responses are submitted for response processing. Possible
values:
\itemize{
\item "individual" - submit candidates' responses on an item-by-item basis. This is

academic grade system as feedback. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{\code{grade_label}}{A character value, optional, representing a short message
to display with a grade in the final feedback. For multilingual usage, it
hat to be a named vector with two-letter ISO language codes as names (e.g.,
c(en="Grade", de="Note")); during test creation, it takes the value for the
language of the operating system. Default is c(en="Grade", de="Note").}

\item{\code{table_label}}{A character value, optional, representing a concise message
to display as the column title of the grading table in the final feedback.
For multilingual usage, it hat to be a named vector with two-letter ISO
language codes as names (e.g., c(en="Grade", de="Note")); during test
creation, it takes the value for the language of the operating system.
Default is c(en="Grade", de="Note").}

\item{\code{show_test_time}}{A boolean value, optional, determining whether to show
the candidate elapsed processing time without time limit. Default is
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{\code{calculator}}{A character value, optional, determining whether to show a
