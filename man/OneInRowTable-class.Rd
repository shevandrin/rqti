answer in each row is possible

\describe{
\item{\code{identifier}}{A character representing the unique identifier of the
assessment task. By default, it is generated as 'id_task_dddd', where dddd
represents random digits.}

\item{\code{title}}{A character representing the title of the XML file associated
with the task. By default, it takes the value of the identifier.}

\item{\code{content}}{A list of character content to form the text of the question,
which can include HTML tags. For tasks of the \link{Entry} type, it must also
contain at least one instance of Gap objects, such as \linkS4class{TextGap},
\link{NumericGap}, or \link{InlineChoice}.}

\item{\code{prompt}}{An optional character representing a simple question text,
consisting of one paragraph. This can supplement or replace content in the
task. Default is "".}

\item{\code{points}}{A numeric value, optional, representing the number of points for
the entire task. Default is 1, but pay attention:
\itemize{
\item For tasks of the \link{Entry} type, it is
calculated as the sum of the gap points by default.
\item For tasks of the \link{MatchTable} type, it can also be calculated as the sum
of points for individual answers, when provided.
\item For tasks of the \link{MultipleChoice} type, points is numeric vector and
required. Each number in this vector determines the number of points that
will be awarded to a candidate if they select the corresponding answer. The
order of the scores must match the order of the \code{choices}. It is possible
to assign negative values to incorrect answers. All answers with a
positive score are considered correct.
}}

\item{\code{feedback}}{A list containing feedback messages for candidates. Each
element of the list should be an instance of either \link{ModalFeedback},
\link{CorrectFeedback}, or \link{WrongFeedback} class.}

\item{\code{calculator}}{A character, optional, determining whether to show a
calculator to the candidate. Possible values:
\itemize{
\item "simple-calculator"
\item "scientific-calculator"
}}

\item{\code{files}}{A character vector, optional, containing paths to files that will
be accessible to the candidate during the test/exam.}

\item{\code{qti_version}}{A character representing the QTI (Question and Test
Interoperability) information model version. Default is 'v2p1'.}

\item{\code{rows}}{string vector; sets answer options as row names in table or the
firsts elements in couples in directed pairs}

\item{\code{rows_identifiers}}{string vector; sets identifiers for answer options
defined in rows of table or identifiers of the firsts elements in couples
in directed pairs}

\item{\code{cols}}{string vector; sets answer options as cols headers in table or the
seconds elements in couples in directed pairs}

\item{\code{cols_identifiers}}{string vector; sets identifiers for answer options
defined in cols of table or identifiers of the seconds elements in couples
in directed pairs}

\item{\code{answers_identifiers}}{string vector; sets couples of identifiers that
combine the right answers}

\item{\code{answers_scores}}{numeric vector, optional; each number in this vector
determines the number of points that will be awarded to a candidate if he
selects the corresponding answer; if nothing assign as answers_scores, the
individual values for right answers calculates from task points and number
of right options}

\item{\code{shuffle}}{boolean, optional; is responsible to randomize the order in
which the choices are initially presented to the candidate; default \code{TRUE}}

\item{\code{shuffle_rows}}{boolean, optional; to randomize the order of the choices
only in rows; default \code{TRUE}}

\item{\code{shuffle_cols}}{boolean, optional; to randomize the order of the choices
only in columns; default \code{TRUE}}
}}
