# Class AssessmentItem

Abstract class `AssessmentItem` is responsible for creating a root
element 'assessmentItem' in XML task description according to QTI 2.1.
This class is not meant to be instantiated directly; instead, it serves
as a base for derived classes.

  By default, it is generated as 'id_task_dddd', where dddd represents
  random digits.

  A character representing the title of the XML file associated with the
  task. By default, it takes the value of the identifier.

  as
  [TextGap](https://shevandrin.github.io/rqti/reference/TextGap-class.md),
  [TextGapOpal](https://shevandrin.github.io/rqti/reference/TextGapOpal-class.md),
  [NumericGap](https://shevandrin.github.io/rqti/reference/NumericGap-class.md),
  or
