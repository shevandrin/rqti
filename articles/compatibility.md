# Compatibility with Learning Management Systems

The files generated by the `rqti` package are fully compatible with the
OPAL LMS. Furthermore, adhering to QTI 2.1 specifications, these files
are suitable for use in any LMS supporting QTI 2.1. You can find a list
of QTI-compatible LMS platforms here:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QTI>.

To upload your tasks to an LMS, create a zip archive containing the test
and import it into the target LMS.

We have conducted compatibility tests by uploading `rqti` zip archives
to LMS platforms such as OpenOlat and Canvas. In most instances, tasks
generated by `rqti` behaved as expected within these LMS platforms.
However, we have identified some inconsistencies, documented below.
Since our files are QTI 2.1 compatible (with verification and automated
tests for all task types), issues typically arise from the LMS side.

If you use a different LMS and encounter problems, please open an issue
on GitHub: <https://github.com/shevandrin/rqti/issues>

## OpenOlat

The following functionalities are currently non-functional on OpenOlat:

- The parameters `include_lower_bound` and `include_upper_bound` in the
  tolerance customization of numeric gaps are ignored. This is a minor
  problem since it is usually irrelevant whether the bounds are included
  or not. Still, we are actively investigating this issue.

## Canvas

The following functionalities encounter issues when used on Canvas:

- The `order` task type is not supported.
- Feedback messages intended to be displayed regardless of answer
  correctness (modal feedback), do not appear. The investigation is
  challenging because Canvas seems to export files in QTI 1.2, not 2.1.
- All feedback types for the `essay` task type are non-functional.
- Customization of tolerance for numeric gaps does not work.
- Management of text input length and placeholders is not operational.
- All tables are converted to the `match` type, rendering only tables
  with a single possible answer in each row meaningful
  (one-in-row-table).
