Please be advised that OPAL has introduced a new attribute for text gaps—`tolerance`—which now accommodates considerations for spelling errors. It is crucial to restrict the use of this attribute to the OPAL Learning Management System (LMS), as it may not be compatible with other Learning Management Systems. Furthermore, it is important to note that employing this attribute will result in the XML files being rendered invalid according to the QTI standard.  # feedback  1.
