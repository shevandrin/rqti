	Many people define good students as those who receive the best grades. While
it is true that good students often earn high grades, I contend that grades are
just one aspect of how we define a good student. In fact, even poor students can
earn high grades sometimes, so grades are not the best indicator of a student’s
quality. Rather, a good student pursues scholarship, actively participates in
class, and maintains a positive, professional relationship with instructors and
peers.
	Good students have a passion for learning that drives them to fully understand
class material rather than just worry about what grades they receive in the
course. Good students are actively engaged in scholarship, which means they
enjoy reading and learning about their subject matter not just because readings
and assignments are required. Of course, good students will complete their
homework and all assignments, and they may even continue to perform
research and learn more on the subject after the course ends. In some cases,
good students will pursue a subject that interests them but might not be one of
their strongest academic areas, so they will not earn the highest grades.
Pushing oneself to learn and try new things can be difficult, but good students
will challenge themselves rather than remain at their educational comfort level
for the sake of a high grade. The pursuit of scholarship and education rather
than concern over grades is the hallmark of a good student.
	Class participation and behavior are another aspect of the definition of a good
student. Simply attending class is not enough; good students arrive punctually
because they understand that tardiness disrupts the class and disrespects the
professors. They might occasionally arrive a few minutes early to ask the
professor questions about class materials or mentally prepare for the day’s
work. Good students consistently pay attention during class discussions and
take notes in lectures rather than engage in off-task behaviors, such as
checking their cell phones or daydreaming. Excellent class participation
requires a balance between speaking and listening, so good students will share
their views when appropriate but also respect their classmates’ views when
they differ from their own. It is easy to mistake quantity of class discussion
comments with quality, but good students know the difference and do not try
to dominate the conversation. Sometimes class participation is counted toward
a student’s grade, but even without such clear rewards, good students
understand how to perform and excel among their peers in the classroom.
	Finally, good students maintain a positive and professional relationship with
their professors. They respect their instructor’s authority in the classroom as
well as the instructor’s privacy outside of the classroom. Prying into a
professor’s personal life is inappropriate, but attending office hours to discuss
course material is an appropriate, effective way for students to demonstrate
their dedication and interest in learning. Good students go to their professor’s
office during posted office hours or make an appointment if necessary. While
instructors can be very busy, they are usually happy to offer guidance to
students during office hours; after all, availability outside the classroom is a
part of their job. Attending office hours can also help good students become
memorable and stand out from the rest, particularly in lectures with hundreds
enrolled. Maintaining positive, professional relationships with professors is
especially important for those students who hope to attend graduate school
and will need letters of recommendation in the future.
	Although good grades often accompany good students, grades are not the only
way to indicate what it means to be a good student. The definition of a good
student means demonstrating such traits as engaging with course material,
participating in class, and creating a professional relationship with professors.
While every professor will have different criteria for earning an A in their
course, most would agree on these characteristics for defining good students.
