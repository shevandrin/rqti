## Minimum version

The simplest exercise type in the rqti package is single choice. A template is available in RStudio when you click on `New file -> R Markdown -> From Template`. The rqti templates start with `QTI`. Here we look at the templates `QTI: singlechoice (simple)` and `QTI: singlechoice (complex)`.

The minimum you need to provide is the `type: sc` (or the equivalent `type: singlechoice`) in the yaml-section and a list with at least two elements in a section called **\# question**:

```{r comment='', echo = F}
path_sc1 <- fs::path_package("exercises", "sc1.Rmd", package = "rqti")
cat(readLines(path_sc1), sep = '\n')
```

Note that in this example, a feedback section was also provided. This is optional, but usually it is a good idea to give some explanation for students.

Further note that the `knit` parameter is set to a custom rqti function, which will handle the preview. This is not necessarily required, but simplifies the workflow substantially. If you leave it out, the default preview is just an html file. If you add our knit function, you will get a more realistic preview.

To see what the final result might look like in a learning management system you can just click the `Knit` button in RStudio. This will produce a rqti xml file and render it in the viewer pane via QTIJS (you can also just fire up the displayed server url in the browser).

The corresponding xml file is created in the same folder as the Rmd file if you click the Knit-Button.
<!-- or in the current directory if you execute the functions from the console. Usually, the Knit button will be sufficient for most use cases, but if you need more control the functions `rmd2qti, render_xml, render_zip` are handy. The functions give a message about the path of the created file. -->

Most learning management systems can directly import a QTI-xml-file, so all you need to do is upload the generated file. Compositions of exercises are covered in the article: [sections and tests](section.html).

If you happen to use OPAL/ONYX, you can also upload your exercises with the knit parameter directly:

```{r eval=FALSE}
knit: render_opal
```

This will upload the file and open a browser with the opal url. It should look like this:

Setting up OPAL requires some additional steps, which are covered in the article: [Setting up OPAL](api_opal.html).

By default the rights of the uploaded material in OPAL are set to public, so no authentication is required to view the material. Otherwise you have to login into OPAL, which will log you out in the API. Please take this into account when testing your material. Without changing the defaults anyone with the link has access to your questions.

<!-- The function `render_opal` will aks you for credentials first. Depending on the OPAL setup you might need to use a VPN. Furthermore only password-based authentication accounts work (Shibboleth does not work). You probably need to consult your IT before using `upload2opal`. More information on this can be found in the article: OPAL API. Specifically, we describe how to setup the API at TU Chemnitz. -->

## Syntax explained

Let us have a closer look at the input file.

```{r comment='', echo = F}
cat(readLines(fs::path_package("exercises", "sc1.Rmd", package = "rqti")), sep = '\n')
```

Note that you do not necessarily need to specify which list element is correct. The first one is treated as the correct one, which is a useful shortcut. If you communicate this to your collaborators, it is also much easier to read. They do not need to look anywhere else in the file for checking the correct answer.

Of course you can specify the correct choice if need be. Our preferred way of doing this is by putting asterisks around this option:

```{r comment='', echo = F}
cat(readLines(fs::path_package("exercises", "sc1b.Rmd", package = "rqti")), sep = '\n')
```

Once again, this is much easier to read than providing the solution somewhere else (e.g. in the yaml section). Furthermore, producing a preview as html directly shows you which element is correct.

An important note: Do not forget to put a blank line before your question and the answer list, otherwise the list will not be a proper list:

```{verbatim}
A question text that is not separated by a blank line
- 1.2
- 2.1
- 3.0
- 2.2
```

Renders as:

> A question text that is not separated by a blank line - 1.2 - 2.1 - 3.0 - 2.2

## More control

If you want to have more fine-grained control, consider the RMD template `QTI: singlechoice-complex`, wich uses many yaml attributes. In addition you can also set feedback for correct and incorrect responses.

```{r comment='', echo = F}
cat(readLines(fs::path_package("rmarkdown/templates/singlechoice-complex/skeleton", "skeleton.Rmd", package = "rqti")), sep = '\n')
```

Which renders in OPAL as:

Let us now discuss all yaml attributes that can be used

## yaml attributes

### type

Has to be `singlechoice` or `sc` (a shortcut for singlechoice) or `schoice` (compatible with `exams` package)

### identifier

This is the id of the exercise, useful for later data analysis of results. The default is the file name. If you are doing extensive data analysis later on, it makes sense to specify a meaningful identifier. In all other cases, the file name should be fine.

### title

Title of the exercise. Can be displayed to students depending on the learning management system settings. Default is the file name.

### shuffle

If `true` (the default), randomizes the order of the choices. Only in rare occasions it makes sense to have a strict order of choices (setting shuffle to `false`).

### orientation

Should the items be displayed in `vertical` or `horizontal` mode? Default is `vertical`.
<!-- ### solution -->

<!-- An alternative way to specify the correct solution by giving the integer of the correct choice. Usually not needed and less intuitive than specifying the correct choice directly in the list of all choices (see above). Note that specifying `solution` will override the manual selection with asterisks. -->

### points

How many points are given for the correct solution. Default is 1.

### calculator

If a calculator is required for this task, you need to assign the 'calculator' attribute the type 'simple' or 'scientific'. This only works on OPAL.

### files

If additional files are required to complete this task, you need to assign the 'files' attribute a single file path or a list of paths to these files. This only works on OPAL.

## Feedback

Feedback can be provided with the section

-   **\# feedback** (general feedback, displayed every time, without conditions)
-   **\# feedback+** (only provided if student reaches all points)
-   **\# feedback-** (only provided if student does not reach all points)

We are generally not fans of conditional feedback. Usually, it will be better to present the whole solution but group it into chunks that can be opened and closed (e.g. html-element details and summary).

## List of answers as a variable

For more complex exercises the list of answers is often just available as a variable. In this case you can use the helper function `mdlist` to convert the vector into a markdown list:

```{r results="plaintext", comment=""}
mdlist(c(1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0), solutions = 2)
```

<!-- make a separate vignette for this -->

<!-- ## A programatic low level approach -->

<!-- The `rqti` package is very flexible in that you can also use low level functions to create rqti content. Let us say you have a csv table with many single choice exercises. It is quite easy to transform this to a rqti section: -->

## Some advice on single choice exercises

From a psychometric perspective single choice exercises are the worst option for ability assessment. This is mainly because guessing can never be ruled out. Psychometric properties will usually be worse than for gap exercises that are similar in content.

In the `exams` package you will see many examples where numeric gaps are transformed into single choice exercises. In our opinion, this only makes sense if the learning management system does not support gap exercises, the support is poor or a print exam with automatic grading is a strict requirement. Otherwise, most exercises will be better with numeric (or string) gaps.

There are situations where single choice exercises cannot be avoided. For instance, exercises regarding the level of measurement only have five choices (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio, absolute). In this case we recommend to ask several questions, not just one. Also, you might want to give less points to single choice exercises in general to reduce the variance caused by guessing.

If you have several single choice exercises where the answer options stay the same, consider using a match table instead: [Match Tables](table.html)

In summary, try to avoid single choice exercises. Specifically, do not transform numeric gap exercises to single choice exercises, unless you have a good reason. If you cannot avoid single choice exercises, ask several questions (with a match table), not just one. Consider giving less weight to single choice exercises in grading.
