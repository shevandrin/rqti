```

## Installation

The `qti` package is still under development. The only way to install it so far is installing from GitHub:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("shevandrin/qti")
```

`qti` have not published yet on CRAN. After publishing it will be possible to install package as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("qti")
```

After installation the package has to be called:

```{r }
library(qti)
```

## Workflow

The basic workflow with `qti` can be presented in 4 main stages:

1. Create Exercise files.
2. Setup Test-object, where Exercises are organized in sections.
3. Generate Test-file according to QTI standard.
4. Upload assessment result file and get raw data for further analysis.

Each step includes certain `qti` functions, the most useful of them are shown in the following diagram:

A more effective approach to learning the workflow is to create a simple exercise, such as "Single Choice", as presented [in this article.](singlechoice.html)
