```{r order, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
source("helper.R")
```

```{r setup order, echo=FALSE}
library(rqti)
```

`r if(knitr::is_latex_output()) "# Order tasks"`

In this type of task, the candidate has to bring a list of items in the correct order.

## Minimum version

A minimum template is automatically created when you initiate an rqti project through RStudio. Alternatively, it can be added by clicking on `New file -> R Markdown -> From Template`. The `rqti` templates end with `{rqti}`. Here we look at the templates `order (simple)` and `order (complex)`.

The minimum you need to provide is the `type: order` in the yaml-section and a list with at least two elements in a section called **\#question**:

```{r comment='', echo = F}
cat(readLines(fs::path_package("rmarkdown/templates/order-simple/skeleton", "skeleton.Rmd", package = "rqti")), sep = '\n')
```

Knitting via the Knit-Button to qtijs, this task renders as`r ltx(" shown in Figure \\ref{order1qtijs}.", ":")`

Alternatively, change the knit parameter to `knit: rqti::render_opal` (see article \ref{working-with-the-opal-api} [Working with the OPAL API](api_opal.html)) to upload to OPAL directly, producing`r ltx(" the output in Figure \\ref{order1opal}.", ":")`

The order of the items in the Rmd-list is considered to be the correct one.

Note that in this example, a feedback section was provided. The feedback is
optional, but usually it is a good idea to give some explanation for students.

## More control

If you want to have more fine-grained control, consider the Rmd template `order (complex)`, which uses more yaml attributes.

```{r comment='', echo = F}
cat(readLines(fs::path_package("rmarkdown/templates/order-complex/skeleton", "skeleton.Rmd", package = "rqti")), sep = '\n')
```

Which on OPAL renders as`r ltx(" shown in Figure \\ref{order2opal}.", ":")`

## yaml attributes

### type

Has to be `order`.

### identifier

This is the ID of the task, useful for later data analysis of results. The default is the file name. If you are doing extensive data analysis later on it makes sense to
specify a meaningful identifier. In all other cases, the file name should be
fine.

### title

Title of the task. Can be displayed to students depending on the learning management system settings. Default is the file name.

### points

How many points are given for the whole task. Default is $0.25n$, where $n$ is the length of the list.

### points_per_answer

Defines the scoring method. If `true` each selected answer will be scored individually (according to the absolute position of the element in the list), if `false` the whole task will be scored and a single error leads to 0 points. Default is `true`.

## Feedback

Feedback can be provided with the section

-   **\# feedback** (general feedback, displayed every time, without conditions)
-   **\# feedback+** (only provided if student reaches all points)
-   **\# feedback-** (only provided if student does not reach all points)

## List of answers as a variable

For more complex tasks the list of answers is sometimes available as a variable. In this case you can use the helper function `mdlist` to convert the vector into a markdown list:

```{r results="plaintext", comment=""}
mdlist(c("Test", "Section", "Item", "Interaction"))
```

## Some advice on order tasks 

Typically, order tasks tend to emphasize memorization of procedural steps, a facet of knowledge that may not always be critically important. In practice, even professionals often rely on checklists or cheatsheets for such scenarios. Additionally, grading order tasks can be intricate since the absolute position of an item is often less crucial than its relative placement within a sequence. We advise to use order tasks with caution.
