knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
library(rqti)
```

## Minimum version

This is just a typical essay exercise. A template is automatically created when you initiate an rqti project through RStudio. Alternatively, it can be added by clicking on `New file -> R Markdown -> From Template`. Here we look at the templates `essay (simple)` and `essay (complex)`.

The minimum you need to provide is the `type: essay` in the yaml-section and some text as a task description in a section called **\#question**:

```{r comment='', echo = F}
cat(readLines(fs::path_package("rmarkdown/templates/essay-simple/skeleton", "skeleton.Rmd", package = "rqti")), sep = '\n')
```

Knitting via the Knit-Button to qtijs, this exercise renders as:

![](images/xml/essay-simple.jpg){width=100%}

Alternatively, change the knit parameter to `knit: render_opal` (see [API Opal](api_opal.html)) to upload to Opal directly, producing:

![](images/essay-simple.jpg){width=100%}

Note that in this example, a feedback section was also provided. Since an open question requires manual review, only general feedback without conditions should be provided. The feedback is optional, but usually it is a good idea to give some explanation for students. Furthermore, a feedback section for essay exercises can serve as a good basis for grading student's answers. In addition the length of the feedback section is taken into account in constructing the text field and the maximum number of words. If no feedback is provided, sensible defaults are used.

## More control

If you want to have more fine-grained control, consider the RMD template `essay (complex)`, which uses more yaml attributes.

```{r comment='', echo = F}
cat(readLines(fs::path_package("rmarkdown/templates/essay-complex/skeleton", "skeleton.Rmd", package = "rqti")), sep = '\n')
```

Which, in Opal, renders as:

![](images/essay-complex.jpg){width=100%}

## yaml attributes

### type

Has to be `essay`.

### identifier

This is the ID of the exercise, useful for later data analysis of results. The default is the file name. If you are doing extensive data analysis later on it makes sense to specify a meaningful identifier. In all other cases, the file name should be fine.

### title

Title of the exercise. Can be displayed to students depending on the learning management system settings. Default is the file name.

### points

How many points are given for the whole exercise. Default is 1. 

### expected_length

Defines the width of the text input field.

### expected_lines

Defines the number of lines of the text input field.

### words_max

Defines the maximum number of words that can be written by the candidate in the text input field.

### words_min

Defines the minimum number of words that must be written by the candidate in the text input field.

### data_allow_paste

Determines whether the candidate is allowed to copy text from the clipboard to the text input field. Default is `FALSE`.

## Feedback

Feedback can be provided with the section

-  **\# feedback** (general feedback, displayed every time, without conditions)

The feedback plays an important role in essay exercises because the expected length and maximum words are calculated from the feedback section, if one is given. Providing useful feedback also defines explicit criteria for grading, so do not skip it for essay exercises, unless you have good reasons to.

Further note that it does not make sense to give conditional feedback as essay exercises have to be graded manually.

## Some advice on essay exercises

Essay exercises can prove immensly diagnostic, provided the instructor poses thought-provoking questions. Regrettably, a considerable number of instructors lack creativity and specificity when formulating essay prompts, resulting in ambiguous grading criteria. To counteract this issue, it is advisable to consistently provide an exemplary solution in the feedback section. This approach not only enriches the learning experience for your students but also garners appreciation from colleagues responsible for grading.
