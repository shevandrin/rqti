## Minimum version

This type of exercise is an open question and refers to an assessment task that allows the candidate to give an answer in a free form without predefined answer options or formats. A template is available in RStudio when you click on `New file -> R Markdown -> From Template`. The qti templates start with `QTI:`. Here we look at the templates `QTI: essay (simple)`
and `QTI: essay (complex)`.

The minimum you need to provide is the `type: essay` in the yaml-section and some text as a task description in a section called **\#question**:

```{r comment='', echo = F}
cat(readLines(fs::path_package("rmarkdown/templates/essay-simple/skeleton", "skeleton.Rmd", package = "qti")), sep = '\n')
```

Note that in this example, a feedback section was also provided. Since only
manual review is possible in this type of exercise, only general feedback is
reasonable, which will be shown after the answer is submitted. The feedback is
optional, but usually it is a good idea to give some explanation for students.

Further note that the `knit` parameter is set to the custom qti knit function,
which will handle the preview. Clicking the Knit button in RStudio produces the
following in the viewer pane (or browser of your choice):

## More control

If you want to have more fine-grained control, consider the RMD template `QTI: essay (complex)`, wich uses more yaml attributes.

```{r comment='', echo = F}
cat(readLines(fs::path_package("rmarkdown/templates/essay-complex/skeleton", "skeleton.Rmd", package = "qti")), sep = '\n')
```

Which renders as:

## yaml attributes

fine.
