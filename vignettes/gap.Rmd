## Minimum version

In this particular exercise format, candidates are tasked with filling in one or multiple gaps. We contend that this method stands out as the most effective means of assessing students' abilities since guessing becomes more challenging compared to forced-choice answers. Focusing on gap exercises will often yield improved test properties.

Within our package, it is feasible to integrate gaps with both textual and numeric responses within a single exercise. This versatility enhances the range of assessment possibilities for instructors.

A template is automatically created when you initiate an rqti project through RStudio. Alternatively, it can be added by clicking on `New file -> R Markdown -> From Template`. The `rqti` templates start with `rqti`: Here we look at the templates `RQTI: gap (simple)` and `RQTI: gap (complex)`.

The minimum you need to provide is the `type: gap` (or the equivalent `type: cloze`) in the yaml-section and some text, where at least one gap is used, in a section called  **\#question**. Furthermore, when employing helper functions from the rqti package, it is essential to ensure its prior loading.

```{r comment='', echo = F}
cat(readLines(fs::path_package("rmarkdown/templates/gap-simple/skeleton", "skeleton.Rmd", package = "rqti")), sep = '\n')
```

Clicking on the Knit-button will produce the following in the viewer pane:

![](images/xml/gap-simple.jpg){width=100%}

Alternatively, change the knit parameter to `knit: render_opal` (see [API Opal](api_opal.html)) to upload to Opal directly, producing:

![](images/gap-simple.jpg){width=100%}

As you can see, there are two ways to create a gap in Rmd content:

- Put the correct answer between `<<` ... `>>` (or the equivalent `<gap>` ... `</gap>`). Example: `<<3.14>>` or `<<sometext>>`
- use the helper functions `?gap_numeric` and `?gap_text` (also see details below, [gap text](#gaptext), [gap numeric](#gapnumeric))

By default, 1 point can be reached for each gap (specify `points` to your needs). The total number of points for completing a task is defined as the sum of points of all gaps.

Note that in this example, a feedback section was also provided. The feedback is
optional, but usually it is a good idea to give some explanation for students. In gap exercises the feedback refers to the whole task, not to a specific gap. Group your feedback into appropriate sections, which can be opened/closed for better user experience (use `<details>` and `<summary>` html tags).

## More control

If you want to have more fine-grained control, consider the RMD template `rqti: gap (complex)`, which uses more yaml attributes and more complex calls of the helper functions.

```{r comment='', echo = F}
cat(readLines(fs::path_package("rmarkdown/templates/gap-complex/skeleton", "skeleton.Rmd", package = "rqti")), sep = '\n')
```

In Opal this renders as:

# yaml attributes

### type

Has to be `gap` or `cloze`.

### identifier

This is the ID of the exercise, useful for later data analysis of results. The default is the file name. If you are doing extensive data analysis later on it makes sense to
specify a meaningful identifier. In all other cases, the file name should be
fine.

### title

Title of the exercise. Can be displayed to students depending on
the learning management system settings. Default is the file name.

## Feedback

Feedback can be provided with the section

-   **\# feedback** (general feedback, displayed every time, without conditions)
-   **\# feedback+** (only provided if student reaches all points)
-   **\# feedback-** (only provided if student does not reach all points)

## Helper function `gap_numeric` {#gapnumeric}

This helper function is designed to generate a formatted string describing a gap in Rmd content, where the answer has a numeric type:

```{r results="plaintext", comment=""}
gap1 <- gap_numeric(solution = 1.4, tolerance = 10, tolerance_type = "relative",
                    points = 5, response_identifier = "mean_value",
                    include_lower_bound = TRUE, include_upper_bound = TRUE,
                    expected_length = 10, placeholder = "put mean value here")
cat(gap1)
```

As you can see, we just use yaml in the end, but for most users it is more convenient to have a specific R function instead.

Argument list of `gap_numeric`:

### solution

Correct numeric answer.

### tolerance

Determines the boundaries of values within which the answer is considered as correct.

### tolerance_type

Determines how the tolerance is calculated. If we have `solution = 50` and `tolerance 10`:

- setting `tolreance_type` to `relative`, would make the interval of the correct answser go from 45 to 55 (50+-10%)
- setting it to `absolute`, produces the interval between 40 and 60 (50+-10)

### points

The number of points for this gap. Default is 1.

### response_identifier

This is the ID of the gap, useful for later data analysis. The default has the format "response_1", "response_2". If you are doing extensive data analysis later on, it makes sense to specify a meaningful identifier.

### include_lower_bound

Specifies whether the lower bound is included in the tolerance interval.

### inclue_upper_bound

Specifies whether the upper bound is included in the tolerance interval.

### expected_length	

Specifies the size of the text input field in the content delivery engine. This value is not directly assigned, it is calculated based on the number of symbols in the solution value. Browsers display the input field length inconsistently, but we have endeavored to establish sensible defaults.

### placeholder

Text displayed in the gap, before an answer is attempted. Can be used for hints (e.g. *numbers only*).

## Helper function `gap_text` {#gaptext}

This helper function is designed to generate a formatted string describing a gap in Rmd content, where the answer is a string/character:

```{r results="plaintext", comment=""}
gap2 <- gap_text(gap_text(c("Bildungsportal Sachsen", "Bildungs Portal Sachsen"),
                          tolerance = 4, case_sensitive = FALSE, 
                          placeholder = "text without special characters",
                          expected_length = 25))
cat(gap2)
```

Argument list of `gap_text`:

### solution

Determines a string vector of values that are considered as correct answers.

### tolerance (works only in LMS OPAL)

Defines how many characters will be taken into account to tolerate spelling mistakes.

### case_sensitive (works only in LMS OPAL)

Determines whether the evaluation of the correct answer is case sensitive. Default is `FALSE`.

### points

The number of points for this gap. Default is 1.

### response_identifier

This is the ID of the gap, useful for later data analysis. The default has the format "response_1", "response_2". If you are doing extensive data analysis later on, it makes sense to specify a meaningful identifier.


### expected_length	

Specifies the size of the text input field in the content delivery engine. This value is not directly assigned, it is calculated based on the number of symbols in the solution value. Browsers display the input field length inconsistently, but we have endeavored to establish sensible defaults.

### placeholder

Text displayed in the gap, before an answer is attempted. Can be used for hints (e.g. *numbers only*).

## Some advice on gap exercises 

Gap exercises are generally foolproof, offering an ideal format by minimizing guessing and often presenting a reasonably high level of difficulty. Numeric exercises, involving calculations that are typically not guessable, are especially effective. While crafting text gaps may be more intricate, the option to offer multiple alternative solutions and leverage Opal to accommodate spelling errors enhances their versatility. Nevertheless, it is important to note that, like any exercise, gap exercises can be poorly designed, so be mindful in their creation.

Here is another tip: To seamlessly integrate single-choice questions with gaps in a single exercise, employ a numeric gap for the single-choice questions and include the solutions within the question. For example, fill in the blank: ____ (0 = not significant, 1 = significant). This approach allows you to use gaps for all questions, showcasing their remarkable flexibility.
