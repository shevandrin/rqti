The files generated by the `rqti` package are fully compatible with the Opal LMS. Furthermore, adhering to QTI 2.1 specifications, these files are suitable for use in any LMS supporting QTI 2.1. You can find a list of QTI-compatible LMS platforms here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QTI>.

To upload your tasks to an LMS, create a zip archive containing the test and import it into the target LMS.

We have conducted compatibility tests by uploading `rqti` zip archives to LMS platforms such as OpenOlat and Canvas. In most instances, tasks generated by `rqti` behaved as expected within these LMS platforms. However, we have identified some inconsistencies, documented below. Since our files are QTI 2.1 compatible (with verification and automated tests for all task types), issues typically arise from the LMS side.

If you use a different LMS and encounter problems, please open an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/shevandrin/rqti/issues

## OpenOlat

The following functionalities are currently non-functional on OpenOlat:

- The parameters `include_lower_bound` and `include_upper_bound` in the tolerance customization of numeric gaps are ignored. This is a minor problem since it is usually irrelevant whether the bounds are included or not. Still, we are actively investigating this issue.
<!-- - The parameter `data_allow_paste` in essays currently does not work because it is implemented differently to Opal. This will be fixed soon. Note that this attribute is not compatible with QTI 2.1. -->

<!-- - Test upload is not operational due to OpenOlat utilizing a custom test structure that is not entirely compatible with QTI. Uploading a QTI test will extract individual tasks, displaying them in Olat, but the overall test disappears. This also happens with the official IMS QTI examples. In the future we will provide a custom class to handle this. -->

## Canvas

The following functionalities encounter issues when used on Canvas:

- The `order` task type is not supported.
- Feedback messages intended to be displayed regardless of answer correctness (modal feedback), do not appear. The investigation is challenging because Canvas seems to export files in QTI 1.2, not 2.1.
- All feedback types for the `essay` task type are non-functional.
- Customization of tolerance for numeric gaps does not work.
- Management of text input length and placeholders is not operational.
- All tables are converted to the `match` type, rendering only tables with a single possible answer in each row meaningful (one-in-row-table).
