`r ltx("# Table tasks", "")`

In this type of task, the candidate matches rows with columns in a table. This format is often used when multiple questions need to be displayed concisely. Table tasks are highly versatile and are ideal for creating both single-choice and multiple-choice questions.

## Minimum version

A minimum template is automatically created when you initiate an rqti project through RStudio. Alternatively, it can be added by clicking on `New file -> R Markdown -> From Template`. The `rqti` templates end with `{rqti}`. Here we look at the templates `table (simple)` and `table (complex)`.

The minimum you need to provide is the `type: table` in the yaml-section and a table in a section called **\#question**:

```{r comment='', echo = F}
cat(readLines(fs::path_package("rmarkdown/templates/table-simple/skeleton", "skeleton.Rmd", package = "rqti")), sep = '\n')
```

Clicking the Knit-Button will produce `r ltx("the output in Figure \\ref{tbl1qtijs}.", ":")`

Alternatively, change the knit parameter to `knit: rqti::render_opal` (see article  \ref{working-with-the-opal-api}[Working with the OPAL API](api_opal.html)) to upload to opal directly, producing `r ltx("the output Figure \\ref{tbl1opal}.", ":")`

In the Rmd file, table entries indicate the points awarded for each response. Any positive number is considered correct. You can also assign negative numbers, which will reduce the total score, but the overall score will never go below zero. You can specify the number of correct responses per row and column as needed, which typically influences how the table is presented. For example, there are special table configurations where only one row is correct per column, and vice versa. The `rqti` package handles these cases automatically, so no additional steps are required on your part.

However, it is important to note that if your table represents a directed pair, the `rqti` package will automatically convert it into a directed pair task. If you prefer to keep it as a standard table, use `as_table: true` in the YAML section of your Rmd file.

The overall points for the task are calculated as the sum of the positive table entries.

Of course you can also just load a csv and print it as a markdown table via `knitr::kable(yourtable)`. Just do not forget that the table has to be the last element of the question section.

In this example, a feedback section was also included. While feedback is optional, it is generally beneficial to provide some explanation to students. However, offering detailed feedback can be challenging for table tasks, especially when questions are presented in random order. Most learning management systems at least indicate which answers are correct or incorrect, so feedback can be more general, focusing on the overall topic.

## More control

If you want to have more fine-grained control, consider the Rmd template `table (complex)`, which uses more yaml attributes.

```{r comment='', echo = F}
cat(readLines(fs::path_package("rmarkdown/templates/table-complex/skeleton", "skeleton.Rmd", package = "rqti")), sep = '\n')
```

Which, in Opal, renders as `r ltx("illustrated in Figure \\ref{tbl2opal}.", ":")`

You can see that the order of the columns is now the same as in the source table.

## yaml attributes

### type

Has to be `table` or `match`.

### identifier

This is the ID of the task, useful for later data analysis of results. The default is the file name. If you are doing extensive data analysis later on it makes sense to specify a meaningful identifier. In all other cases, the file name should be
fine.

### title

Title of the task. Can be displayed to students depending on the learning management system settings. Default is the file name.

### shuffle

If `true` (the default), randomizes the order of rows and columns. Only in rare occasions it makes sense to have a strict order of elements (setting shuffle to `false`). Overwrites `shuffle_rows` and `shuffle_cols`.

### shuffle_rows

Only shuffle the rows. Default is `true`. Overwritten by `shuffle`.

### shuffle_cols

Only shuffle the columns. Default is `true`. Overwritten by `shuffle`.

### abbr_id

Defines the use of an abbreviation as a way to generate row and column identifiers. Explained in more detail in the section \ref{ids} [Managing identifiers](#ids).

## Feedback

Feedback can be provided with the section

-   **\# feedback** (general feedback, displayed every time, without conditions)
-   **\# feedback+** (only provided if student reaches all points)
-   **\# feedback-** (only provided if student does not reach all points)

## Managing identifiers {#ids}

The identifiers for rows and columns are valuable for later data analysis. If you plan to conduct extensive analysis, it is beneficial to assign meaningful and easily recognizable identifiers.

Currently, there are two methods for creating row and column identifiers:

1. **Default Method**: By default, `rqti` generates identifiers in the format `row_1`, `row_2`, ..., `row_N`, and `col_1`, `col_2`, ..., `col_N`.
2. **Abbreviation Method**: By setting `abbr_id: true` in the YAML section of your Rmd file, `rqti` generates identifiers by combining the first word of a row or column element with an abbreviation of the remaining text. For example, the element "Mean Value Theorem for Integrals" would be shortened to "Mean_VTfI". If a row or column name starts with digits, `rqti` automatically adds a "row" or "col" prefix, as identifiers cannot begin with a number. Special characters are also removed.

After experimenting with various approaches, we settled on these straightforward methods. If you require more control over the identifiers, please open an issue on GitHub: <https://github.com/shevandrin/rqti/issues>. We are open to reconsidering the available options.

<!-- 3. For more control, you might want to assign your own values as identifiers. -->

<!-- ```{markdown} -->
<!-- | ROWID       | row     | 27 | 36  | 25 | 6 | -->

## Some advice on table tasks 

Table tasks are forced choice tasks, so they suffer from the sample problems as [single choice](singlechoice.html) and [multiple choice](multiplechoice.html) tasks. The advantage of table tasks is that they are easy so manage (e.g. in csv-tables) and many questions can be asked at once, using little space.
