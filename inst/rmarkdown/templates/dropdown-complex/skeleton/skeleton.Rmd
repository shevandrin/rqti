# question

The philosophy of the qti package is <<do one thing and do it well|one for all>>.

Under the hood, the qti package uses `r dropdown(c("no OOP", "S4 OOP", "S3 OOP", "R6 OOP"), answer_index = 2, score = 5, response_identifier = "OOP_task", choices_identifiers = c("noOOP", "S4", "S3", "S6"))`.

# feedback

The package `qti` is specialized for producing xml qti files so "do one thing and do it well" is more appropriate. Under the hood we use S4 OOP.
