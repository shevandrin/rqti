# question

## numeric gaps

IQ Tests are standardized to have a mean value of <<100>>.

You conducted an IQ test for 10 persons and found the following values: 

`r iq`

What is the mean value of these IQ values? `r gap_numeric(mean(iq))`

The same question, but now with a tolerance of +-5: `r gap_numeric(mean(iq), tolerance = 5)`

The same question, but now with a relative tolerance of +-5%: `r gap_numeric(mean(iq), tolerance = 5, tolerance_type = "absolute")`

In the last gap, the tolerance was set to 5, meaning that the solution+-5 is treated as correct. The parameter `tolerance_type` determines how the tolerance is calculated. Setting it to `relative`, would make the interval go from solution+-5% of the solution.

## text gaps

The original IQ test was developed by `r gap_text(c("Alfred Binet", "Binet", "A. Binet"))` in the early 20th century with the intention of identifying students who might need extra assistance. Over the years, IQ tests have evolved, and various versions exist today, such as the WAIS, standing for `r gap_text("Wechsler", case_sensitive = F, tolerance = 2)` Adult Intelligence Scale, and the <<Stanford>>-Binet Intelligence Scales.

Please be advised that OPAL has introduced a new attribute for text gaps—`tolerance`—which now accommodates considerations for spelling errors. It is crucial to restrict the use of this attribute to the OPAL Learning Management System (LMS), as it may not be compatible with other Learning Management Systems. Furthermore, it is important to note that employing this attribute will result in the XML files being rendered invalid according to the QTI standard.

# feedback

1. IQ Tests are standardized to have a mean of 100.
1. The correct mean value for `r iq` is `r mean_iq`.
1. The original IQ test was developed by Alfred Binet.
1. WAIS: W stands for Wechsler
1. It is the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales.
