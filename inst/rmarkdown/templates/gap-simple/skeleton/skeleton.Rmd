# question

## numeric gaps

IQ Tests are standardized to have a mean value of <<100>>.

You conducted an IQ test for 10 persons and found the following values: 

`r iq`

What is the mean value of these IQ values? `r gap_numeric(mean(iq))`

See `?gap_numeric` for more options (e.g. tolerance).

## text gaps

The original IQ test was developed by `r gap_text(c("Alfred Binet", "Binet", "A. Binet"))` in the early <<20th>> century with the intention of identifying students who might need extra assistance.

See `?gap_text` for more options (e.g. tolerance).
