# question

What are the advantages and disadvantages of the `qti` package as compared to the `exams` package?

# feedback

The qti package can only export to the QTI format, which makes it less general than the `exams` package. But the qti package supports more exercise types, can preview xml files and has a very solid core architecture based on S4 OOP and many tests.
