# question

What are the advantages and disadvantages of the `rqti` package as compared to the `exams` package?

# feedback

The rqti package can only export to the QTI format, which makes it less general than the `exams` package. But the rqti package supports more exercise types, can preview xml files, supports the OPAL API and has an extensible core architecture based on S4 OOP.
