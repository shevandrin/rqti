# question

The philosophy of the rqti package is <<do one thing and do it well|one for
all>>.

Under the hood, the rqti package uses `r dropdown(c("S4 OOP", "S3 OOP", "no
OOP", "R6 OOP"))`.

# feedback

The package `rqti` is specialized for producing xml rqti files so "do one thing
and do it well" is more appropriate. Under the hood we use S4 OOP.
