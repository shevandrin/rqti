# question

The philosophy of the qti package is <<do one thing and do it well|one for all>>.

Under the hood, the qti package uses `r dropdown(c("S4 OOP", "S3 OOP", "no OOP", "R6 OOP"))`.

# feedback

The package `qti` is specialized for producing xml qti files so "do one thing and do it well" is more appropriate. Under the hood we use S4 OOP.
