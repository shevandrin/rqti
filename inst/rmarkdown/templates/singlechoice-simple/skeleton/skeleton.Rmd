# question

An alpha error of 5% means that:

- There is a 5% probability that you will mistakenly reject the null hypothesis, when it is actually correct <!-- First option is treated as the correct one by default. -->
- There is a 5% probability that the null hypothesis is correct.
- There is a 5% probability that you will mistakenly reject the alternative hypothesis, when it is correct.
- The test power is 95%.

# feedback

The correct interpretation is:

There is a 5% probability that you will mistakenly reject the null hypothesis, when it is correct.

This is based on the typical understanding of a 5% significance level in hypothesis testing, which means that you are willing to accept a 5% chance of making a Type I error.
