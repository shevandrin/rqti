# question

Which exercise types are supported by the R package qti?

- *dropdown list*
- programming language evaluation

# feedback

All basic types of QTI are supported, including dropdown list. More advanced exercises (as available in OPAL/ONYX) are not yet supported because they are LMS specific.
