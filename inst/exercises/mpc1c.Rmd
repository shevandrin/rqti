# question

Which exercise types are supported by the R package rqti?

- *match pair (pair several elements)*
- *match tables (single choice or multiple choice tables)*
- drawing
- graphical match (drag selection to specific position)

# feedback

All basic types of QTI are supported. More advanced exercises (as available in OPAL/ONYX) are not yet supported because they are LMS specific.
