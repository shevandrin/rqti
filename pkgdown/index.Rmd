# rqti

Note: this is work in progress, a stable release can be expected in Q4 2023.

The goal of `rqti` is to provide a clean and independent R library for creating exercises and exams according to the [QTI](https://www.imsglobal.org/question/qtiv2p1/imsqti_implv2p1.html)
 standard directly from R. You can render the exercises locally (qtijs) or to the learning management system Opal.

## Installation

The `rqti` package is still in development. The only way to install it at the moment is from GitHub:

```{r eval=FALSE}
#install.pacakges("librarian") # install librarian if you do not have it yet
librarian::shelf(shevandrin/rqti)
```

<!-- `rqti` have not published yet on CRAN. After publishing it will be possible to install package as follows: -->

<!-- ```{r eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- install.packages("rqti") -->
<!-- ``` -->

Note that this will start a qtijs server, which will be used for previewing exercises. If you do not need this, turn it off with the environment variable: QTI_AUTOSTART_SERVER=FALSE (in your .Rprofile or in .Renviron).

## Quick start

Using RStudio, go to create a New Project, select **"QTI Project"** as the project type in the New Project Wizard window and and configure some settings. Choose 'YES' for 'Create Templates' to get Rmarkdown templates for all types of tasks in the working directory.

In addition, it is possible to add a new one from the templates. To do this, go to create a new Rmarkdown file, select **from Template** and choose one of the templates starting with **QTI: ...**. The *simple* ones include the minimum, the *complex* ones have more parameters. Click the Knit-Button and you should see a rendered exercise in the Viewer pane. The templates are self-explanatory, but more details about the exercise types can be found in the other articles:

- [Single choice](articles/singlechoice.html)
- [Multiple choice](articles/multiplechoice.html)
- [Essay](articles/essay.html)
- [Gap](articles/gap.html)
- [Dropdown](articles/dropdown.html)
- [Order](articles/order.html)
- [Directed pairs](articles/directedpairs.html)
- [Tables](articles/table.html)

To combine different exercises into a test, read: [Sections and Tests](articles/section.html)

If you are using the learning management system Opal, please check out [Opal API](articles/api_opal.html)

## General workflow

The basic workflow with the `rqti` package can be described as follows:

1. Create exercise files.
    1. Create an Rmd document. You can start from scratch (specify `type` in the yaml section) or use Rmd templates starting with the prefix `QTI`.
    1. Write a section titled `# question` and create your interactions (gaps, choices, etc.). Use rqti helper functions where needed.
    1. Set additional attributes in the yaml section. All types are explained in detail in the **Articles** menu on this website (top).
    1. Choose a previewer: Either qtijs (`knit: rqti::render_qtijs`), which will render your exercise locally or the learning management system Opal (`knit: rqti::render_opal`). Note that using Opal requires you to set it up first: [Opal API](articles/api_opal.html).
    1. Check if your task looks as desired. Modify until your are satisfied.
1. Create sections and tests based on your exercise files.
1. Write test (xml) to disk according to QTI standard and upload test file to your learning management system.
1. Download results data from your learning management system and read it in with the rqti package for statistical analysis.

Each step includes certain `rqti` functions, the most useful of them are shown in the following diagram:

The best way to learn the workflow is to create a simple exercise, such as "Single Choice", as presented [in this article.](articles/singlechoice.html)

Each exercise type is described in a separate article:

- [Single choice](articles/singlechoice.html)
- [Multiple choice](articles/multiplechoice.html)
- [Essay](articles/essay.html)
- [Gap](articles/gap.html)
- [Dropdown](articles/dropdown.html)
- [Order](articles/order.html)
- [Directed pairs](articles/directedpairs.html)
- [Tables](articles/table.html)

## Feedback and bug reports

Feel free to [let us know](mailto://shevandrin@gmail.com) which features your are missing or directly [open an issue on GitHub.](https://github.com/shevandrin/rqti/issues) 

<!-- Why do we need another package for creating exams when there is already the `exams`-package? The philosophy of `exams` is **one for all**, whereas `rqti` follows the Unix-philosophy: **do one thing and do it well**. tldr: -->

<!-- - `rqti` has more (QTI) features (e.g. exercise type) than `exams` -->
<!-- - `rqti` uses OOP (S4), the system is easy to extend (LMS specific needs) -->
<!-- - the Rmd-interface is cleaner as it just focues on QTI -->
<!-- - low-level functions can be used flexibly to create exercises -->
<!-- - `rqti` puts a premium on testing, with currently over 100 tests -->
<!-- - rendering of QTI files in the browser (or viewer pane of RStudio) directly from R -->
<!-- - functions to upload files via REST API to LMS (for us OPAL, but you can implement your own) -->

<!-- If you just use QTI-exercises, you should check out our package. If you need different formats next to QTI, e.g. print, LMS that do not support QTI stick to `exams`. -->

<!-- Just focusing on QTI gives us more time to support great features of the QTI standard that are missing in `exams`. For instance, `rqti` offers dropdown-inputs, ordering-exercises, and match-tables. -->

<!-- ## Installation -->

<!-- ```{r eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- install.packages("librarian") # skip if you have librarian already -->
<!-- librarian::shelf(shevandrin/rqti) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ##  -->

<!-- ## What is not possible -->

<!-- - Composites (several exercise types in one task) are not implemented because they do not work in our LMS (OPAL); several gaps do work, though -->
<!-- - Associates are not implemented because they does not work in OPAL -->


<!-- ## Comparison between exams and rqti -->

<!-- The `exams` package uses templates and pastes strings together to create rqti files. This has some disadvantages: it is error prone, not easy to maintain and difficult to extend. If for instance, a new exercise type needs to be added, many locations have to be changed. `rqti` is supposed to make life easier by providing some standard functions to create all parts of the QTI xml file. -->

<!-- Extending exams is just a matter of composing the correct `rqti` functions. Testing small `rqti` functions is easy, whereas the main function of `exams` `make_item_body` consists of 736 lines. Indeed, this function has grown substantially over time (todo: provide evidence). -->

<!-- Based on rqti one can also develop new interfaces for creating exercises. -->
